# Project_IronMan-2


PROJECT_IronMan

Right now, we’re developing J.A.R.V.I.S., an advanced AI assistant inspired by the Iron Man universe, while simultaneously working on the engineering challenges behind a real-world Iron Man suit. And yes — our vision includes becoming billionaires, not for the sake of money alone, but to fund the innovations, resources, and breakthroughs needed to bring this technology to life.

Why are we doing this?
Because the world deserves a future where flying isn’t reserved for airplanes, where lifting a car is just another Tuesday, and where your personal AI assistant can help you solve problems, learn new things, and enhance your daily life in ways never before imagined.

Our goal is not just to create one suit or one AI — it’s to open the door for a wave of new inventions that will one day be available to the public. We believe in a future where anyone can feel the thrill of soaring through the clouds, the power of moving mountains (or at least refrigerators), and the confidence that comes with having cutting-edge technology at your fingertips.

At our core, we are inventors, dreamers, and doers. We are here to prove that “superhero” doesn’t have to stay a word in comic books — it can be a reality, built with engineering, creativity, and a lot of coffee.

So join us. Support us. Help us turn fiction into fact.
Because deep down, we all want to be a hero… don’t we?

P.S. the  JARVIScore.py is not JARVIS its a decoy, the actual JARVIS is just named JARVIS.py

and we need help with it so could you help donate
